# Earth From Lab to Planet Tutorials

This repository contains numerical tutorials - Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts - for the undergraduate course ***Earth From Lab to Planet*** (GEO 315L) 
instructed by Prof Thorsten Becker and Prof. Peter Flemings at the University of Texas at Austin from 2023 to 2026.

The material ranges from basic introduction to Python, to simple line plots and fitting of straight lines to data with errors, to solved ODEs, and quite involved solution
of PDE, for example for Stokes flow using an interface to FEniCS. Material could be orgznized better, but should be helpful for a range of solid earth systems classes.

Software development was led by Dunyu Liu with support from Thorsten Becker, partially based on exercises developed earlier in Matlab for 

Becker, T. W. and Kaus, B. J. P (2015): Numerical Modeling of Earth Systems: An introduction to computational methods with focus on solid Earth applications of continuum mechanics.
